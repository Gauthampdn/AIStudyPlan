# AI Study Plan Creator

## Overview
This application is an AI study plan creator where students can input a topic and the amount of time they plan to study. The application then generates a detailed study plan for the user based on this input.

## Functionality
The application uses artificial intelligence to generate a comprehensive study plan based on the user's input. It imports `useState` and `ReactMarkdown` libraries from React, and `Form` component from the file `Form.js`. It also imports the OpenAI API and sets up the necessary configurations.

## Code Breakdown
The `handleFormSubmit` function in the code takes in the user's input, prompts the OpenAI API to generate a study plan, and sets the response text using the `setResponseText` function. The application uses the `responseText` state to display the generated study plan in a `ReactMarkdown` component.

## User Interface
The user interface of the application includes a header with the title "The Ultimate Plan Maker" and a tagline introducing the plan maker, Otto. The `Form` component allows the user to input their desired topic and hours of study, and the generated study plan is displayed below the form using the `ReactMarkdown` component.
